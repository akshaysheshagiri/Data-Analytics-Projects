**About Me**
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a dedicated professional with a diverse background in Mechanical Engineering and a growing expertise in Data Analytics. My journey has been fueled by a curiosity to understand and solve complex problems, whether it's optimizing engineering processes or deriving insights from data. With a strong analytical mindset and a passion for continuous learning, I strive to deliver meaningful results in every project I undertake.

In the field of Data Analytics, I specialize in tools like Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel, enabling me to transform raw data into actionable insights. I am currently learning Python and its powerful libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to further enhance my ability to work with data efficiently and effectively.

My foundation in Mechanical Engineering has equipped me with a deep understanding of design, analysis, and manufacturing principles. I have hands-on experience with tools like ANSYS, SolidWorks, and DLP 3D Printing, and Iâ€™ve worked on impactful projects, including one funded by KSCST. This technical background complements my analytical skills, allowing me to approach challenges with a unique perspective.

Beyond work, I enjoy traveling to explore new cultures and landscapes, which inspires creativity and broadens my horizons. I am also an avid coin collector, fascinated by the history and stories behind each piece.
